	Hey, I’m Shashwat-a fellow tech enthusiast with nearly 2 years of hands-on experience as a full stack software and data engineer. I’ve worked across both frontend and backend, building with React and Node.js, and have also designed and maintained ETL pipelines for data engineering using PySpark for Leading American Insurance Firm with highly scalable sensitive data. I’m comfortable working in the cloud, with solid exposure to AWS and DigitalOcean. On top of that, I’ve dabbled in game development using Unity and Godot, so I love bringing creative ideas to life.I have worked in MNCs and startups giving exposure to production grade practices and high velocity environments.  
	   
	  
	I’m passionate about building robust, scalable solutions and collaborating with teams that value innovation and learning. If you’re looking for someone who can jump between web apps, data pipelines, and even  work on game engines, I’m confident I’d be a fantastic addition to your team!
