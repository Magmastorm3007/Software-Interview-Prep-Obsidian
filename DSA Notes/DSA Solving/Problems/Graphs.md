Okay for rotten oranges type BFS GOOD
for counting islands DFS Good

Atlantic and pacific ocean flow inward use heights logic can be done with both bfs and dfs but depends u get the logic

Clone graph ->make new nodes and do dfs

Course schedule->Cycle->Kahn algorithm easily

Number of conencted componets and redundant components
Bro its union find though look into this rank thing but its kinda shady

But love Union Find




OKay so we got to advanced graphs part

1:Path with Minimum effort 

Djikistra

See its actually not that deep 
BFS+min Heap from bfs you are going through paths( generally i didnt have to keeep visited) on minheap you keep effort or anything that you want it to be scaled and the vertexes from sec to dist, good to build adjaceny list of some sort so you can find it easily from a src verttex and check dist, oh yeah keep it INT_MAX that ought to help

Cheapest flights with K stops

Possible with djikstra but bellman ford is slightly easier and better in the pq if going with di=jikstra keep count of the stops I think its pretty good

Alien Dictionary:
Question that makes you cry as you code but hey its just fancy or not so fancy topological sort
See aliens have pretty bad grammar but hey atleast they gave us order or I would break this laptop screen right now and send them back to krypton
